# Local DB Setup

Super simple DB setup where i can train to use DBT and Dataiku.

## Parts

1. Use local instal of PostgreSQL (contaierized) on own computer (always on).
2. Ingestion of some streaming data (most likely Binance + network traffic or something). Or own API wrappers (with Airflow).
3. Dataiku training - familiarize with most basic of Dataiku, focus on differences and similarities between Dataiku and DBT
4. DBT training - get familiar with DBT and GitHub integration, CI/CD, probably airflow is needed as well

## Goals

1. Be able to translate Dataiku projects and recipes to DBT projects and models efficiently, potentially scripted.
2. High level of understanding of DBT, weaknesses, strengths and opportunities.
